The LeNet-5 architecture is the most widely used architecture of convolutional neural networks.
It includes 7 layers, excluding the input layer, which contains the trainable parameters called weights.

1.Layer C1 is a convolutional layer with six feature maps where the size of the feature maps is 28×28;

2.Layer S2 is a sub-sampling layer with six feature maps where the size of the feature maps is 14×14;

3.Layer C3 is a convolutional layer with sixteen feature maps where the size of the feature maps is 10×10;

4.Layer S4 is s sub-sampling layer with sixteen feature maps where the size of feature maps is 5×5;

5.Layer C5 is a convolutional layer with 120 feature maps where the size of the feature maps is 1×1;

6.Layer F6 contains 84 units and is fully connected to the C5 convolutional layer.
